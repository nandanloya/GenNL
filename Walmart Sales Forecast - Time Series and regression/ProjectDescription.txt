Description:
Forecasting sales of Walmart store using historical data and other features impacting sales across 3 categories in Clothing- Women's , Men and other.
By forecasting and thereby predicting sales, Stores can better quip themselves and have an overview of coming year in terms of monetary gains.
A statistical evidence  and factors influencing sales was done. So that stores have better idea and model reports to create a strategy for increasing business.

Time series models : Holt-Winter's Model (Triple Exponential Smoothing) , ARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMAX (Effect of exogenous variables was tried)
Regression Algorithms : Linear, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor.

Evaluation metric used was Root Mean Squared error
Optimal Performance Found : 
    Holt-Winter's (TES)               : RMSE: 137.81696
    GradientBoostingRegressor : RMSE: 271.54052  
Regression Model was done for knowing which factors influenced sales. 

Appendix:
1.The Dataset was provided by Great Learning as a part of Case Study Kaggle Competition.
2.The purpose/objective was to predict sales of year2014 making it a Time Series problem.
3.Regression models were built to understand the impact of Features on Sales across Categories.
4.Prescriptive Analytics can be further explored given more data.
